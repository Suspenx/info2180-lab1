 <h2>Vaughn-Dale Spence</h2>
 <p>Greetings! I'm Vaughn-Dale Spence an aspiring software engineer known for my spontaneous nature and for delightful surprises. In my leisure time, I enjoy the art of baking, nurturing gardens, and offering occasional babysitting services when the need arises. 
    One day I look forward to the day when I muster the courage to embark on exhilarating adventures like dirt biking and bungee jumping.As for now, as  an upcoming software engineer I do think having the ability and knowledge of web development is crucial in todays society.
    Essentially, it will help further my carrer and aid in allowing me the flexibility to having possible options in the computing field.</p>
